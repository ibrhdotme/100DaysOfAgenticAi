# 100 Days of Agentic AI

Hey 👋! I'm [Ibrahim](https://x.com/ibrhdotme). I'm fascinated by Autonomous Systems. Starting January 1st, 2025, I’m dedicating time every day to learn more about this exciting field. 

Inspired by #100DaysOfCode, I’ve started #100DaysOfAgenticAI to stay accountable by building, experimenting, failing, and learning in public. I’ll document my progress along the way.

I invite you to join me! To participate:
- Make some progress every day, no matter how small. [#NonZeroDays](https://old.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/deleted_by_user/cdah4af/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20more%20zero%20days.)
- Share your progress daily using the #100DaysOfAgenticAI hashtag.
